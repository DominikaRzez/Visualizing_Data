In the UK, police have had the power to stop and search since 1824, this was known as “sus law”, shortened from “suspected persons”. However, the main legislation that covers police use of stop and search powers was implemented in 1984. 

Stop and search has long since been a point of controversy, as the police are able to stop and search anyone if they have “reasonable grounds”. Although in theory, no one should be stopped based on ethnicity, age, or gender, there is no actual way of policing this as it is done on opinion only.

There is already known data from gov.uk that states between April 2019 and March 2020, there were 563,837 stop and searches in England and Wales. From those 563,837 stop and searches, there were 6 for every 1000 White people, compared to 54 for every 1000 Black people. London had the highest stop and search rates for all ethnic groups, except for Other (where it was highest in Kent) and White (where it was highest in Merseyside).

Looking into the data of police stop and searches in major cities in the UK may bring to light biases within this practice. Using data from the police stop and search API, we will be looking to identify trends throughout different cities regarding those stopped and searched. What is the average or most common profile of a person likely to be stopped and searched and does that differ between cities?

We will be looking specifically at the ethnicity, gender, age and object of search (reason for stop), to discover whether there are certain biases or trends within this data.
